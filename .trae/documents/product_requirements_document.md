## 3. Core Process

### Administrator Flow
Administrators begin by accessing the system through multi-factor authentication, then proceed to the administration dashboard where they can manage users, configure system settings, monitor security compliance, and access comprehensive audit trails. They can create user accounts with appropriate security clearances, configure interview parameters, and monitor system performance across all components.

### Selector Flow
Selectors authenticate and access their personalized dashboard showing scheduled interviews and performance analytics. They create new interview sessions by configuring evaluation criteria, question categories, and participant lists. During interviews, they join the 3D boardroom environment where they can ask questions while receiving real-time AI feedback on question quality, bias detection alerts, and candidate evaluation insights. Post-interview, they access comprehensive reports and analytics for decision-making.

### Candidate Flow
Candidates receive interview invitations and authenticate using their credentials. They access their dashboard to view upcoming interviews and preparation materials. During interviews, they join the immersive 3D boardroom where they interact naturally while the system provides real-time translation support if needed. Their responses are evaluated by AI for semantic relevance, technical accuracy, and communication quality, with constructive feedback provided post-interview.

### Observer Flow
Authorized observers can monitor live interviews through the observation interface, accessing real-time analytics and evaluation metrics without disrupting the interview process. They can generate reports and access historical data for quality assurance and training purposes.
